                    California had experienced record dry and warm conditions in 2013, and California had used reservoirs to 
                    help meet the water supply demand during this time. California had prepared for the dry season in many ways including the <a href = 'http://www.norcalwater.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/droughtsoutline-july2013.pdf'>following</a>:
                </p>
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li class = 'GG'>1:  California Governor issued an Executive Order in May 2013 to have an orderly and flexible system to allocate water supplies. The orderly allocation process includes various contracts with the state and federal government. This orderly process allow voluntary water transfers more flexible on short-term basis during a serious drought.  </li>
            <li class = 'GG'>2:   California Governor directed the California Department of Water Resources to prepare a California Drought Contingency Plan (DCP) in 2008. The plan is the State government’s strategy for managing and developing water resources statewide for current and future generations. The DCP’s purpose is to minimize drought impacts by improving agency coordination, enhancing monitoring and early warning capabilities, and preparedness and recovery programs.</li>
            <li class = 'GG'>3:  Brown signed drought relief legislation worth $687 million in March 2014. It included $25.3 million for food and $21 million for housing for those like farmworkers who are out of work. President Obama announced the federal government would chip in $183 million to the parched state.</li>

                    During dry periods, each agency and individual, based on their local circumstances, will implement various local actions to help their area get through these dry periods. This includes pumping groundwater, neighbor to neighbor water transfers, internal water management and crop idling. There are three important water management actions that will help the region through dry periods:

        <ul>
            <li class = 'LL'><strong>Flexible Water Transfers</strong>
Transfer of water is one flexible way to advance the economic, social and environmental sustainability. It is on a short-term basis to work within the current water system.  </li>
            
            <li class = 'LL'><strong>The Value of Surface Storage</strong>
The existing carryover water storage from 2015 has helped much of the state through intensely dry period in 2016.</li>
           
            <li class = 'LL'> <strong>Sustainable Groundwater Management</strong>
Groundwater levels and quality in the State are generally excellent according to reports by the <a href = 'http://www.water.ca.gov/'>Department of Water Resources</a>. This is important because groundwater pumping is increased for all uses 
during dry periods to make up for surface water supplies that are not available.</li>
