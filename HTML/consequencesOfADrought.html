        <h1> Effects/Consequences of Droughts: </h1>

        <div id = "paragraph 1" class = "Paragraph 1">  
                <p>
                According to <a href = 'http://drought.unl.edu/DroughtforKids/HowDoesDroughtAffectOurLives/TypesofDroughtImpacts.aspx'>National Drought Mitigation Center</a>, drought can lead to many devastating effects on communities and our environment. The level of devastation depends on the strength of the drought and the duration an area is considered to be in drought condition. Drought normally has a greater impacts on poorer communities than prosperous communities who have better ways to bring in resources from other areas. The many consequences of droughts are often grouped as economic, environmental, and social impacts.

        <h2>Economic Impacts:</h2>

        <div id = "paragraph 2" class = "Paragraph 2">  
                <p>
                Consequences of drought that make people to lose money are grouped as economic impacts. Drought affects us both directly and indirectly. Drought can directly affect the agricultural businesses, and farmers can have devastating lost. Water may become polluted during times of drought due to the lack of rain water to dilute industrial and agricultural chemicals. Crops yield will be very low and farmers will have to close production. Local farm produce sellers will have nothing to sell. Farmers also have to spend more money on the water supply whether on irrigation or to drill new wells if they are low on water resources. California in the dry Central Valley alone lose $810 million in 2014 from keeping their fields idle according to <a href = 'https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/drought-impact-study-california-agriculture-faces-greatest-water-loss-ever-seen'>UC Davis Center for Watershed Sciences</a>. They also spent an extra $453 million on pumping water out of the ground.
This had started to affect the price of fruits and vegetables in the United States. California produces half of the fruits, vegetables and nuts grown in the United States. That means that the price of agricultural product will also increases. For instance, the majority of the nation’s lettuce is grown in California, and the prices went up 1.9 percent during the drought in May 2014.

        <h2>Environmental Impacts:</h2>

        <div id = "paragraph 3" class = "Paragraph 3">  
                <p>
                    Drought also affects the environment in many different ways. The effect can be categorized into three different types that are energy, wildfires, and wildlife. Hydroelectric turbines operating on large water reservoirs provide about 15 percent of California’s electricity. Water reservoirs are abnormally low, and reducing the hydropower to California. California has to generate the energy rely more on non-renewable sources like natural gas.

        <div id = "paragraph 4" class = "Paragraph 4">  
                <p>
                    California already had more than <a href = 'http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-california-fires-drought-20160607-snap-story.html'>1500 wildfires that burned nearly 28,000 acres</a> of lands as drought conditions continue for a fifth year for the first six months this year. The Central Valley fire killed four people and destroying about 2,000 structures. Two people were killed and about 900 structures destroyed in Butte fire.

        <div id = "paragraph 5" class = "Paragraph 5">  
                <p>
                    <a href = 'https://www.thoughtco.com/environmental-consequences-california-drought-1203876'>While much of the wildlife in California can weather temporary dry conditions</a>, a prolonged drought can lead to increased mortality and reduced reproduction. Many species are endangered of habitat loss. Many species of migratory fish are endangered in California, mainly salmon. The flow in rivers are too low due to the drought reduce access to spawning places.

        <h2>Social Impacts:</h2>

        <div id = "paragraph 6" class = "Paragraph 6">  
                <p>
                    The social implication of drought is perhaps the most felt, as they directly involve is directly involve us and our families. Health is always link to the water supply, where clean water prevent and manage disease. Drought has consequences for human health, both physical and emotional. While some people may not be impacted very much, for some communities the impact may be quite significant.

       <h2>The possible public health implications of drought include:</h2>

       <ul>
        <li>Compromised quantity and quality of drinking water</li>
        <li>Increased recreational risks</li>
        <li>Effects on air quality</li>
