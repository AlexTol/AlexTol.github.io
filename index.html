                What we would like this site to be is a convenient junction of where Californians can learn the truth about the drought and how it affected society, provide tips to <a href = 'HTML/beforeDrought.html'>prepare for a drought</a>, and gain an understanding that California is no stranger to droughts.  We would also like to inform you about the <a href = 'HTML/infrastructureAndProjects.html'>infrastructure of water systems</a> in California briefly, but also provide <a href = 'HTML/infrastructureAndProjects.html#uLinks'>links</a> to those who would like easy access to more information about water sources, systems, and conservation projects in California

            <h1> Who is using the water?: </h1>

                    Everyone. Most of the water that is acquired in California is divided among three major groups. According to <a href = 'https://mavensnotebook.com/the-notebook-file-cabinet/californias-water-systems/'>Maven’s Notebook’s</a> gathered information, roughly 54% of water is used in agriculture, 32% is used for the Central Valley environment, and the remaining 14% is divided amongst households, businesses, industry, and landscaping.

            <h1> How much water do Californians use?: </h1>

                
            <div id = "paragraph 1" class = "Paragraph 1">  
                <p>
                  According to data gathered by the <a href = 'https://ca.water.usgs.gov/water_use/index.html'>U.S. Geological Survey</a>  in 2010, the average consumption of water for Californians is about <strong>one-hundred and eighty-one gallons </strong> of water per day. Take a second to consider the amount of water consumption that goes on based on the millions of people that live in California. According to the U.S. Geological Survey data in 2010, California has been the state with the largest water use and had used a rough average of <strong> 38 billion gallons </strong> of water per day.  This is considering the water use between households, businesses, and farmers in California.
